# Write your code here :-)
#1. Construct a truth table for the expression: (A AND B) OR (NOT B) where A and B each can be True or False.
#Your truth table should be commented out (as it's not valid Python code!)
#A,B     (A AND B)     (NOT B)    OR(NOT B)
#T T         T           F           T
#F F         F           T           T
#T F         F           F           T
#F T         F           T           F

#2. The headlights of a car should only automatically turn on when the daylight outside is below a certain threshold.
#If a sensor threshold is below the number 8, print "Headlights On"; otherwise, print "Headlights Off".
sensor=2
if sensor < 8:
    print("Headlights on")
else: print("Headlights off")

#3. Prompt the user for their bank balance. Evaluate whether the balance is less than $100.
#Print True if the userâ€™s balance is below $100; print False, otherwise.
balance=int(input("How much is in your balance?"))
if balance < 100:
    print(True)
else:
    print(False)

#4. A theater wants to enforce age restrictions for movie tickets. Ask the user for their age, and tell them whether they can see G
#(appropriate for under 13), PG-13 (appropriate for 13 to 17), or R (appropriate for over 18) rated movies.
age=int(input("How old are you"))
if age < 13:
    print("you can see G rated movies")
elif 13 <= age <= 17:
    print("you can see PG-13 rated movies")
elif age > 18:
    print("You can see R rated movies")


#5. A store charges $5 for shipping on any order under $50. If the order amount is $50 or more, shipping is free.
#Ask the user for the order total and print the total cost, including shipping.
cost=int(input("What is the cost of your order? "))
if cost < 50:
    total=cost + 5
    print("Your total is $",total)
else: print("Your total is $",cost)
